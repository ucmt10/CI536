                You can find out more information about our Service and its features by exploring the website. </ol> 
               </ol>
               <ol>ii.  You can sell your items through our Service by publishing pictures of the item you want to sell (“Sell”). 
                When another user of the Service purchases such Sale Item, this is a “Sale Transaction”.
               </ol>
               <ol>iii. Payment for transactions must take place via our first party payment provider (the heckout of the websute), 
                It is unsafe to make payments outside of the service.Requesting, making or accepting payment for an item in any other way is a serious breach of the Terms of Service 
                and may result in us suspending or terminating your access to the Service in accordance with section 8 of these Terms of Service.</ol>
                <ol>
                    iv. We want our Service to be a positive experience for our users and we ask that you honour the commitments you make to another user in respect of the swap, sale or purchase of a Sale Item.
                    To safeguard the interests of our users, we do not recommend using the Service to swap Sale Items. However, if you choose to do so, you should follow our guidelines for swapping safely available here on our help site. 
                    In any event, you acknowledge that you swap Sale Items entirely at your own risk and we have no liability in this respect.
