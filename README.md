Few notes about the php

Has :)
-sign up
-log in
-header changes state depending on if ur signed in or not
-a sell page that has a working form and inputs to books table on database 

To Fix
-some things need to be reshuffled AKA once you guys check the log in/register system works on your end we need to move buy and sell to be accessible to logged users only etc.
-sql injection protection for the sell form
-need to move some pages to have header.php (some dont becuase it was hard to keep track back and forth soz ill fix as they pop up)
-when books are listed it gives a 404 cuz idk if we wanna have a success page or route user back to an existing one?
-the books table is all VARCHAR might be good to make more specific
-the css has gone a bit wonky, esp when php is getting involved
-...and anything that ineveitbly breaks when u guys try and test it becuase this project likes to gaslight me
